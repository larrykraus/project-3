# project-3

- Elevator Pitch: 
All of the most common weather websites are completely ugly - too many adds and too much useless information. Since the weather information is readily available through API's, we decided to make our own aesthetically pleasing weather website. We also added a Colorado element to it, by providing ski weather for many of the popular CO ski resorts.

- Research findings: 
Our interviews revealed three major findings. 1) Everyone agreed their go-to weather website was not aesthetically pleasing. 2) Their weather websites did not give them the particular information desired (too much/too little). 3) No one felt particularly attached to the weather website they currently use.

- Technologies used: 
We utilized Express and Node on the back end to extend JavaScript's reach. For our database, we used SQL/Sequelize which made our interconnected model possible. Angular was crucial on the front end, we leaned heavily on the directives to populate our weather information. Pulling in several Bootstrap elements saved us time and made our site more visually appealing. Lastly, this group project could not have been coordinated or completed without GitHub (shout out to SourceTree for the helpful visualization).

- Plans for future: 
In the future, we would like to add other activities (ex. kayaking) which will take users location input and display different weather information (ex. recent rainfall). We'd also like for users to be able to customize their general weather display. Some users may want to see a more specific weather information while others prefer a cleaner design with minimal info.
